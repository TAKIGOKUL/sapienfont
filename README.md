# [SAPIENTYPE] üéØ

## Basic Details

### Team Name: [Agentic Ninjas]

### Team Members

- Team Lead: [Gokul G K] - [CE Adoor]
- Member 2: [Manas Manoj] - [CE Adoor]

### Project Description

A revolutionary typing classifier that analyzes your keyboard mashing patterns to determine what type of human you are - from "Caffeinated Coder" to "Angry Email Writer" to "Password Forgetter Extraordinaire."

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Ever wondered why your typing sounds different when you're angry vs when you're happy? Neither have we! But we solved it anyway. The world desperately needed a way to classify humans based on their completely meaningless typing patterns and keyboard abuse habits.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

SAPIENTYPE uses advanced AI (actually just random number generators and if-statements) to analyze your typing rhythm, force, and pattern to categorize you into one of 12 completely made-up human archetypes. Because apparently your QWERTY skills define your entire personality!

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

For Software:
- **Languages used**: Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Frameworks used**: Flask (for web interface), React (for frontend chaos)
- **Libraries used**: 
  - `keyboard` (for keystroke detection)
  - `numpy` (for fake mathematical analysis)
  - `random` (for our "AI" decisions)
  - `time` (for measuring typing intervals)
  - `matplotlib` (for impressive-looking but meaningless graphs)
- **Tools used**: VS Code, Git, Pure Imagination

For Hardware:
- **Main components**: Any keyboard (mechanical preferred for maximum dramatic effect)
- **Specifications**: 
  - CPU: Literally any computer from this decade
  - RAM: 4GB (2GB for the app, 2GB for the developer's tears)
  - Storage: 100MB (mostly for meme images)
- **Tools required**: Keyboard, caffeine, questionable life choices

### Implementation

For Software:

#### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/agenticninjas/sapientype
cd sapientype
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

#### Run
```bash
# Start the backend
python app.py

# Start the frontend (in another terminal)
npm start

# Open browser and start typing nonsense
# Visit localhost:3000
```

### Project Documentation

**Caption**: Results page showing you're a "Midnight Snack Typer" - a completely scientific classification

**Caption**: Comparison with other users because everything needs to be competitive these days

### Project Demo

#### Video
[Demo Video Link - YouTube/Drive]
**Demonstration**: Shows a user typing "Hello World" and being classified as a "Existential Crisis Typist" based on their 2.3-second pause between words.

#### Additional Demos
- Live demo where team members get completely different personality types while typing the same sentence
- Comparison of typing the same password 5 times resulting in 5 different human classifications
- Speed run of discovering you're apparently 12 different types of humans in one minute

## Team Contributions

- **Gokul G K**: 
  - Built the "AI" classification algorithm (random number generator with fancy variable names)
  - Created the web interface that somehow works despite all odds
  - Came up with the 12 human archetypes while procrastinating

- **Manas Manoj**: 
  - Implemented keystroke detection and timing analysis
  - Designed the results visualization (made graphs look scientific)
  - Tested the app extensively by typing angry emails to himself

## The 12 SAPIENTYPE Classifications

1. **Caffeinated Coder** - Types in bursts, lots of backspaces
2. **Angry Email Writer** - Heavy keystrokes, aggressive spacing
3. **Password Forgetter** - Hesitant typing with long pauses
4. **Hunt & Peck Survivor** - Slow but determined
5. **Midnight Snack Typer** - Inconsistent rhythm (probably eating)
6. **Meeting Multitasker** - Random pauses (checking phone)
7. **Existential Crisis Typist** - Types, deletes, types again
8. **Speed Demon** - Fast but chaotic
9. **Perfectionist** - Many corrections, precise timing
10. **Procrastination Expert** - Starts strong, gradually slows down
11. **Social Media Scroller** - Short bursts, distracted patterns
12. **The Overthinker** - Long pauses between every word
