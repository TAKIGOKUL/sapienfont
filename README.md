# [SAPIENTYPE] üéØ

## Basic Details

### Team Name: [Agentic Ninjas]

### Team Members

- Team Lead: [Gokul G K] - [CE Adoor]
- Member 2: [Manas Manoj] - [CE Adoor]

### Project Description

A revolutionary typing classifier that analyzes your keyboard mashing patterns to determine what type of human you are - from "Caffeinated Coder" to "Angry Email Writer" to "Password Forgetter Extraordinaire."

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

yes , keyboard exists , lets forget that fact of a minute , humanity cant sit waiting
they have to communicate , they have to program . not hand signs , body postures itself ...!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

SAPIENTYPE uses advanced AI (actually just random python libraries and opencv and if-statements) to analyze your body posture, force, and pattern to categorize you into one of 26 english alphabets. Because apparently your QWERTY skills define your entire personality!

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

For Software:
- **Languages used**: Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Frameworks used**: Flask (for web interface), React (for frontend chaos)
- **Libraries used**: 
  - `keyboard` (for keystroke detection)
  - `numpy` (for fake mathematical analysis)
  - `random` (for our "AI" decisions)
  - `time` (for measuring typing intervals)
  - `matplotlib` (for impressive-looking but meaningless graphs)
- **Tools used**: VS Code, Git, Pure Imagination

For Hardware:
- **Main components**: Any keyboard (mechanical preferred for maximum dramatic effect)
- **Specifications**: 
  - CPU: Literally any computer from this decade
  - RAM: 4GB (2GB for the app, 2GB for the developer's tears)
  - Storage: 100MB (mostly for meme images)
- **Tools required**: Keyboard, caffeine, questionable life choices

### Implementation

For Software:

#### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/agenticninjas/sapientype
cd sapientype
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

#### Run
```bash
# Start the backend
python app.py

# Start the frontend (in another terminal)
npm start

# Open browser and start typing nonsense
# Visit localhost:3000
```

### Project Documentation

For Software:

**Caption**: Results page showing you're a "Midnight Snack Typer" - a completely scientific classification


#### Diagrams

### Project Demo

#### Video
[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1flvktEdovbtX87apN2m5uN-rf29YPNBZ/view?usp=drivesdk]
**Demonstration**: Shows a user typing "Hello World" and being classified as a "Existential Crisis Typist" based on their 2.3-second pause between words.

#### Additional Demos
- Live demo where team members get completely different personality types while typing the same sentence
- Comparison of typing the same password 5 times resulting in 5 different human classifications
- Speed run of discovering you're apparently 12 different types of humans in one minute

## Team Contributions

- **Gokul G K**: 
  - Built the "AI" classification algorithm (random number generator with fancy variable names)
  - Created the web interface that somehow works despite all odds
  - Came up with the 12 human archetypes while procrastinating

- **Manas Manoj**: 
  - Implemented keystroke detection and timing analysis
  - Designed the results visualization (made graphs look scientific)
  - Tested the app extensively by typing angry emails to himself
